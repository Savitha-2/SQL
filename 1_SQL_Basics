15. Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.

Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.
    
    SELECT name,
           ROUND(gdp/population, -3) AS per_capita_gdp
      FROM world
      WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000;   

---  ROUND(number, decimal_places)
-- If decimal_places is a positive number, the number is rounded to the specified number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point.
-- If decimal_places is 0, the number is rounded to the nearest integer.
-- If decimal_places is a negative number, the number is rounded to the left of the decimal
-- (-1 means round to the nearest 10)
-- (-2 means round to the nearest 100)
-- (-3 means round to the nearest 1000)



 16. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.

     SELECT name, capital

    SELECT name, capital
      FROM world
      WHERE LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital, 1)
        AND name <> capital;

---LEFT(name, 1) → first letter of country name

--LEFT(capital, 1) → first letter of capital ,  = → checks if first letters match

--name <> capital → excludes cases where both are the same word
