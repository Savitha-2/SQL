---  ROUND(number, decimal_places)
-- If decimal_places is a positive number, the number is rounded to the specified number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point.
-- If decimal_places is 0, the number is rounded to the nearest integer.
-- If decimal_places is a negative number, the number is rounded to the left of the decimal
-- (-1 means round to the nearest 10)
-- (-2 means round to the nearest 100)
-- (-3 means round to the nearest 1000)



 16. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.

    SELECT name, capital
      FROM world
      WHERE LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital, 1)
        AND name <> capital;

---LEFT(name, 1) → first letter of country name

--LEFT(capital, 1) → first letter of capital ,  = → checks if first letters match

--name <> capital → excludes cases where both are the same word

        AND name LIKE '%o%'
        AND name LIKE '%u%'
        AND name NOT LIKE '% %';
--AND name NOT LIKE '% %' → excludes names with spaces
--LIKE '%a%' → checks if 'a' is present anywhere in the name
--LIKE '%e%' → checks if 'e' is present anywhere in the name
--LIKE '%i%' → checks if 'i' is present anywhere in the name
--LIKE '%o%' → checks if 'o' is present anywhere in the name    
--LIKE '%u%' → checks if 'u' is present anywhere in the name
--All conditions combined with AND to ensure all vowels are present


19. Show the name and population of countries where the population contains all four digits: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

--CAST(population AS CHAR) → converts population number to string for pattern matching
--LIKE '%1%' → checks if '1' is present anywhere in the population string 
--LIKE '%2%' → checks if '2' is present anywhere in the population string
--LIKE '%3%' → checks if '3' is present anywhere in the population string 
--LIKE '%4%' → checks if '4' is present anywhere in the population string

24. Show all details of Nobel prize winners whose subject is either 'Chemistry' or 'Peace' and who won the prize in or after 1990 but before 2000.  

    SELECT *

25. Show year, subject, and name of people who won a 'Medicine' prize in an early year (before 1910, not including 1910) together with winners of a 'Literature' prize in a later year (after 2004, including 2004)

    SELECT yr, subject, winner
      FROM nobel
      WHERE (subject = 'Medicine' AND yr < 1910)
         OR (subject = 'Literature' AND yr >= 2004);

---(subject = 'Medicine' AND yr < 1910) → filters Medicine winners before 1910
---OR → combines the two conditions
---(subject = 'Literature' AND yr >= 2004) → filters Literature winners from 2004 onwards


26.List the winners, year and subject where the winner starts with Sir. Show the the most recent first, then by name order.

27. Show the 1984 winners and subject ordered by subject and winner name; but list chemistry and physics last.

SELECT winner, subject
  FROM nobel
